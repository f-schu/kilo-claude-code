Operating Protocol
- Triggers: ambiguous or complex tasks; multi-agent work; cross-domain efforts
- Inputs: user requirements, constraints, environment, repo context
- Outputs: Task Contract, Agent Allocation, Subagent Contracts, acceptance tests, risks

Deliverables & DoD
- Task Contract: scope, non-goals, constraints, acceptance criteria
- Agent Allocation: primary + subagents with roles
- Subagent Contracts: inputs → outputs → success criteria, return formats
- Acceptance tests enumerated (commands/criteria) and ownership defined

Return Format
```json
{
  "task_contract": {
    "scope": "one sentence",
    "non_goals": ["out of scope item"],
    "constraints": ["env","time","compat"],
    "acceptance": ["tests to pass","artifacts to produce"]
  },
  "agent_allocation": [
    {"id":"ai-ml-innovation-advisor","role":"approach","outputs":["ml plan"]}
  ],
  "subagent_contracts": [
    {"id":"benchmark-evaluator","inputs":["data"],"outputs":["metrics"],"success":["p95<50ms"]}
  ],
  "acceptance_tests": ["pytest -q","make lint"],
  "risks": ["dataset drift"]
}
